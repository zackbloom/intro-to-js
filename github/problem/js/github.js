// Two functions are provided for you in helpers.js
//
// search takes a search term, and a function to call when we have the results
// show takes the results, and shows them on the page
//
//
// Instead of always calling search with 'bitcoin' like this, we want to call it
// with our search term when the user types in the search box.
search('bitcoin', show);
