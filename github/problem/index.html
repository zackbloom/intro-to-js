           <p>Let's build a GitHub Search UI!</p>

           <p>GitHub has a wonderful <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/search">API</a>.
            Start by <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications">grabbing
            an auth token</a>, and adding it to the end of the url of this page.  I have a bit of code
            in token.js which grabs it out of that hash, and makes it available for our search code,
            but don't worry about it now.</p>

            <p>Once that's done, you should see a list of bitcoin projects below the
            search box.  Unfortunately, the content of the search box is irrelevant right now,
            no matter what, we always search for bitcoin!</p>

            <p>Your task is to change this page such that when I type into the search box,
            it actually searches for what I ask for.</p>

            <p>We're going to be making requests to the Github API.  I don't want you to get lost in the
            weeds of how that works just yet, so I've written the actual request-y bit, and packaged it
            up into a nice little function for you.  You can just call <code>search</code> with your search
            term and a function you'd like it to run with the list of results.</p>

            <p>Put all of your code in <a href="js/github.js">js/github.js</a>.</p>

            <h3>What you'll need</h3>

            <dl>
                <dt>anyInput.value
                <dd>The current value of the input

                <dt>anyInput.addEventListener('keyup', fn)
                <dd>Runs fn whenever a key is pressed in the input

                <dt>document.querySelector('.search')
                <dd>Return the first element on the page with class 'search'
            </dl>

            <h3>Bonus</h3>

            <p>Show a loading spinner.  There's a loading gif in the imgs folder.</p>

            <input class="search" placeholder="Search github..." value="bitcoin">

            <ul class="results"></ul>
