            <p>As you have seen, it's certainly possible to do all sorts of things with just what
            the browser gives us.  Historically however, this used to be much less true.  Even today,
            if you want to support older browsers, it can be helpful to use a library which abstracts
            away compatibility fixes for you.</p>

            <p>Beyond that, the browser makers can't move as quickly as frontend developers do.  Therefore
            there are all sorts of brilliant libraries out there which exist to make our lives easier.</p>

            <p><strong>jQuery</strong> is without a doubt the most popular library used today.  It will
            almost certainly be used by any web app you work on in the near future.</p>

            <p>jQuery gives you a better syntax to do things like finding elements and making requests.
            To get a feel of how it works, you're going to rebuild our time example.  This time however,
            we're going to request the time from an API which is available at <a href="http://timeapi.org">
            timeapi.org</a>.</p>

            <p>jQuery is already included on this page, and is accessed as <code>$</code> (the dollar symbol).
            All the methods you need are below, be sure to follow the links to get more explanation of 
            how they work.</p>

            <p>Hit this URL from your code to get the time in a nice format:
            <a href="http://www.timeapi.org/utc/now?\a%20\b%20\d%20\I:\M:\S">http://www.timeapi.org/utc/now?\a%20\b%20\d%20\I:\M:\S</a>.</p>
